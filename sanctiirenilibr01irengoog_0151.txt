sufficiently descriptive of the lower Ogdoas the region of
Achamoth3 it was the cradle of creation, from whence the
earliest germ of the material dated its rise. Again, 1τόπος,

the Ιιαῠὶίον of Demiurge, was in tbe Platonis scheme the
recipient of the eternal conception of things material in

the Divine Intelligenee, and it had its counterpart in the
Pythagoreas τὰ aevis, the breathiug ground, as it were, of

the animated world3 ¹oi Πυθαγόρου irruis eluar τοῦ κόσμου

restis, sis d dunusci ὁ κόσμοι καὶ ἐξ αὖ. Achamoth then

was placed for the present εἷς ‘triv riwepovptivsov τόπον τούτο μοι
εστιν ἓν τῇ μεσότητι, where the term μεσότης also was
suggested by Plato's μεσότητει enharmonio meaos, which We
he interposes in the generation of ψυχή. And further the
constitution of Demiurge himself, intellectual but not
spiritual, and evolved by Achamoth at the sometime with

the prot-ideal substance of matter, is in close barmony

with the formation of the mundane soul in Plato; the
Creator having taken a portion of indivisible substance, aiei nur-³³

ble, formed of them a third mean substance τρίτου ἐξ

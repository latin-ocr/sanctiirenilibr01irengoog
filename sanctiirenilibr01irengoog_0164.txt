cxliv VALENTINUS.

Plato utterance to the mere human suggestions of intellect,
fssffld at another to the inspiration of the spiritabilem another
*- place he declares that he speaks the wisdom οὐ τοῦ αἰῶνος
leonto τούτου, but the wiedom of God; words that the Valentinian
would interpret of Achamoth. It will not be necessary to

ruffi· advert to any of their more palpable perversione of Scrip-

ture, for they add nothing to our knowledge of Valentinian
principles3 they only illustrate them.

Altogether, therefore, we have seen that the Valenti-
nian system, in many of its notione, resembles the scheme
set forth in the Timaeus of Plato; and since the philosopher
adopts ¹Pythagorean ricus, more especially with reference
to the mundane soul aud numerical harmonica, it is pro
bahle that this phase of Gnosticism gave back to the East
that which had been horrowed from it, several centurias
before, by the great master of physical philosophy. To
these two systema of ancient speculation, therefore, we
have chiefly reverted for the light that has served to guide
us through this many system. The purely Oriental element
consiste in little else than the explanation of the creation
and harmonious action of the universe, hy supposing a
series of successive emanatione, to be re·absorbed into the
Divine Nature3 but always, whether in emanative diffusior,
or in concentrated sublimity, God was All Things‚ and
All Things were God. Baur, therefore, is perfectly right
when he eorrects the notion put forth hy Mosheim‚ and
so generally received, that we must look to the Oriental
systems of philosophy for an explanation of the Valentinian
theory; for it symboliscs rather with modes of thought
prevalent in Graeca and, so far as Oriental notione are
involved, we trace them back to the Cabhala that the Jews
brought away from Babylon, rather than to Zoroaster or

numne reflective imitation of the ideal, ικόσα ἀνάγκη τόνδε τόν

Q κόσμον κὶκόνα τίνος εἶναι. The phenomena of the visible
creation are ’όμακκόματα τόν ἐκεῖ, and the physica] attribute
of sense is τοιοῦτον οἷον τό όν, such as the ideal reality.
But the entire Platonic theory is based upon this pluma.
vherein the material has its true counterpart in the κ’ᾱσαὶς
and Valentinus can have received from no other source

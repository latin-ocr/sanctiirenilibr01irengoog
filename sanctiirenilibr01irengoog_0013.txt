Book and the opening chapters of the second, bave

MS. ; but this is far from certain. Some of the cor·

rectione are manifest conjectures. In any case the

original sorirce ol them was never known. The same
degree of doubt scarcely applies to the readings marked
by Grabe as Mero. 1. and 11. They are noted in the

not appear that one copy was marked 1. and the
other 11.

Erasmus put forth three editions of Irenaeus in the
years 1526, 1528, 1534; and atter his death, Stieren

edition between 1545 and 1570, when the edition of
Gallasius appeared at Geneva‚ and contained the first
portione of the original Greek text from Epiphanius.
It was agreat step in advance. In the following year
Grynaeus put forth an edition of a very different charae-

dent's edition appeared, the first of a series of six that

preceded Grabe in 1702. In Grabe's Oxford Edition
considerable additions were made both to the Greek
original, and fragments ; and the text was greatly
improved by a collation of the Arundel MS. with addi·
tions from the Ood. Voss, Ten years later the Bene

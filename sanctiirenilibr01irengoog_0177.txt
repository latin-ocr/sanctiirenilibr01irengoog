sible to assent ιο the opinion advauced by ¹Valesius, that ornans,
henaeus, having been designated as the bearer of the Q
epistle to Eleutherus, was preferred to the see that had
become vacant by the death of Pothinus before the

letter was dispatched; in this ease, the name of his sub-

, stitute must infallibly have replaced his own in the letter;
whereas Eusebius quotes as the commencement, ’χαίρειν
ἐν θεῷ σε ἐν πᾶσιν εὐχόμεθα nal del πάτερ Ἐλεύθερα· τοῦτο’
σοι rd ’γράμματα προετρεψάιιεθο τᾶν ἀδελφόν ἡμῶν nal κοι-
νιονὸν Εἱρηναῖον διακομίσαι. ³S. Jerome, who was well ae·
quainted with the Roman archives and Roman traditione,
confirms the statement Irenaeus then was the bearer of
this Epistle to Rome, an. 177. The persecution of the
Church of Lycus, though sharp, was brief. Pothinus, ‘now
more thau niuety years old, was subjected ιο such cruel
treatment as ιο die in prison; and this took place, in all
probability, before heuaeus had crossed theAlps; if therefore
it was necessary that his successor should be consecrated

to Rome was most opportune; a messenger dispatched at
once would have arrived within a few days of heuneus,
making known the request of the suffering Church, that he
might be consecrated to the see of Lyons. 'lhis suppo
sition clears away all historical difficulties; for Eusebius
says expressly‚ both that Irenoeus went to Rome, as has
been stated, also that he was successor to Pothinus, who
must have died while he was out upon this mission. ‘llo-

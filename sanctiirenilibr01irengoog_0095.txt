¹Carpocrates, an Alexandrian Jew ot the Platonic Oura

school, setting aside his hatred of the Jewish and every Q
other law, agreed in many points with the Ebionite. He
taught the mere human origin os J e'sus; and his misbalief
upon this point accounts for his repetition of the Ebionite
assertion, that a like degree of sauctit)¹ was within reach

of any other munsiaco all human souls are from the
same source, and share the same nature. But his impiety aaa
in this respect carried him to a more ²feurful pitch of
blasphemy than his predecessore. Irenaeus states that he
treated with equul reverence the liheness of Christ, and

of the heathan philosophers, Pythagoras, Plato, and
Aristotle3 if we take into account that his successor Pro·
dicus professed to have the Apocalypsis of ³Zoroaster as

his text-book, we may collect that syncreticisnr in the
widest sense was the true Carpocratian principle. Eren

the heathen mysteries perhaps met with no disfarour from
him. He in fact appears to have given a wider expansion

to Gnosticism, and where his predecessore, in ascribing
the creatiou of the world to certain creatire angelic
powers, imagined to themselves an efflux from the Good
Principle, Carpocrates carried the Oriental principle out

to its fullest exteut; and, with a rooted dislike to his
former religion, affirmed that these creator angels, by

’ reason of the remoteness of their origin from the source nm

of all, were in fact ⁴cvil iu their nature; and that the
great object of Christ’s mission to the human race was,
that he might redeem mankind from the power of these

torpori-oroi ἄγγελοι.

Similarly, his mode of describing the first Principle
agreed with that of most other Gnostic teachcrs, and the
Source of all, that in the Simonian theory was ἀόρατος,

Mans triple division of his nature into body, soal, aud spiritthose l
iffi} that were under bondnge to the freter the choic, were
‚, · wholly out of the rcach of salvetiom the psychic or animal
' ' man, as the Church Catholic was called, was only so far
sslvahle‚ as he made choice for himself of good, ἐὰν τὰ
βελτίονα ἕληται· but then there was no admission for
· . him into the Pleroma; he had his Rest in the Mean, or
Μεσότης, where Achamoth for the present received the
souls of the Just3 and whither Demiurge, upon her final
promotion to the Pleroma, should ascend after the lower
worlds had passed away. But if the animal man made
choice of evil, his eternel lot was, χωρήσειν πρός τὰ ὅμοια,
i. e. like the choic, cic τήν φθοράν. The spiritual, that
is Valentinian heretice, alone were admitted into the
Pleroma, from whence their origin vvus dated; for at
the final restitution of ull things, Achamoth eud the
spirits that had been transfused hy her into the world,
should be admitted into the Pleroma, and mated with
’ΨΜ the engels, their consorte. Numerically therefore the
. “¹⁹¹² sum of the elect was κατ’ ἀριθμόν ἀγγέλων Θεοῦ. The
soul however, or mere animal and intellectual principle,
had no entrance into the Pleroma, it was divested of
the spirit, as of the body, and remeined without ἐν
· · μεσότητι, with Demiurge and the other souls of the just.
dhe souls of men therefore alone, as occupying the mean
between the carnal and the spiritual, were capable of u
· two-fold division, accordingly as they inclined to the higher
or the lower principle; the better souls might receive the
seed, the worse never. The spiritual principle and the
material were respectively cui qenais, they were both

inconvertible end incapable of further modification.

The morel effect of such doctrine wss pernicious in the

extreme3 Irenseus gives a dark picture of its working
within his own immediate observation, aud such as the
heresy was on the banks of the Rhone, it also was in Asia.

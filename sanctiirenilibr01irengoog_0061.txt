pabulam. The same half century that saw the Magian um·
worship of lire established in the east by zoroaster, as the -α-ὴ-ως-
purest material emblem of the deity, found Heraclitus of
Ephesus giving a similar directiou to the philosophica] sana
mind in Asia Minor, by asserting that lire was tbe first
principle. Either teacber worked the sels-same notion
up into form, making ita symbol, tbe oue of a rc·
ligious, the otber of a philosophical creed.

Heraclitus, as a native of a highly vulcania regn'on, the
κατακεκαυμένη of the ancients, naturally enough adopted
this theory. It does not appear to have made many
eonverts, though his speculations in other respecta bad
considerable influence upon the fortunas of philosophy.
The Stolos built upon his foundation; Plotinus applied
his theory; for if Heraclitus said that the Deity was πῦρ
νοερόν, the founder of the NeoPlatonio school also taught ff δρρρι
that me Diwine Mind acted on matter through the eternal
ideas, by an intimate combination‚ as tbe secret energy
of lire, ¹tbe Divine Ideal being a liery efflux. In other
respecta Heraclitus had his points of coutact with Zoroas-
ter; Discord, or πόλεμος, was as his Atrinum and the idea
ol multiplicity in unity is contained in his dictum, tbat
unity dividat ont is a aelf-combination‚ 'rai yo'p ἔν φησι
διαφερόμενον, αὐτό αὐτῷ ξυμφέρεσθαι. He gave a prece-
dent to Gnostic seli-conceit in affirming, αὑτὸν τὰ πάντα
εἰδέναι τούς ll ἄλλους ἀνθρώπους οὖδᾶν. Simon Magus,
though in the spirit rather of oriental theosophy, asserted
a ficry first principle, which was afterwards inherited from
him by the Marcionita.

Empedocles, aa. 450, embodied the preceding prin-
ciples, and referred the origin of all tbings to six effecting
canses; two material, two organic, and two demiurpicr

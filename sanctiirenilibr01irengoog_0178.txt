m. work members already in danger, but Irenoeus eould searoely have
ffllest it in iu hour of greatest need, if the storm bad already
burst in iu full fury, endiis bishop been put to death.

In proportion as this risit to Rome shews, as a pro·
bable result, the elevation of Irenoeus to the vaoant see,
the prosecution of his journey to the far distent Euat, aa
stated by Feuardentius and Le Sueur, becomes in the
seme degree improbable. Neither is it ot all likely, that
be should have been the author ot' the aeeount of the per·
secution seut from Lyous to the Cburebes of Asia, if he
bed not been an eye-witness. Rather we may believe that
be returned home to be installed suoeeseor to Pothinus,
and milder times following, that be engaged notively in the
missionnry work of eonverting pagan Gaul to curiae for he
was most truly 1φωστὴρ Γαλατῶν τῶν ἑσπερίων, eud ’Be-
eaneon end Valenee are more expressly mentioned, as having
received the saith from Lyons during his incumbenoy. The
same period of respite from perseeution also permitted
the Bishop to compone his great work against the beresies
that foroed themselves upon bis notioe during his visit to
Rome, an'd that, penetrnting into every provinoe of the
Western Empire‚ were gsining head rnpidly upon the
banks of the Rbone. The work wns written, as Eusebius
bas observed‚ during the Episcopate of Eleutheros, down
to whom the Romen suecession istraeed in tbe third
Book; but it was composed also aiter Theodotion had
eompleted his version of the Scriptures of the Old Testa·
ment; referred by ³Epiphanius to the second year of Gom·
modus, an. 181. Therefore sinee Eleutherna was sue·
needed by Victor sn. 189, this work must have been writ-

ten some time during the seven years ineluded between
sn. 182 end 188.

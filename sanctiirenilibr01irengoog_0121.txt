rethereel region having been reduced into order by him,
and the ¹365 heavens, termed Aurana, created, another
ἅρχων emenated from the subjective matter, and he
obtained the subordinate name of ἄρρητοι. His sublunary
habitat was the Hebdomad, and was ῥητόι.

Both of these subordinate entities were inferior in
dignity and power to the lower aon-hood, still inherent in
the world of matter. The Demiurge, for such was the
title and fonction of the lower principle thet inhabited
the Hebdomcd, also engendered a son of the quickened
mass of matter, who, es in the preceding instance, ’was
of greater excellence than the sire. But although the
Demiurge reduced matter into order, it was according
to the preconceived plan of the ³Irrocrwtablc. Here again
ophilosophical bearing for the myth of heresy may be
discerned; the pantheist allowed that a soul of life per-
vaded the entire creation‚ but failed to see the agenoy of
a higher influence, from whence proceeds that which we
now call the ‘course os nature. And so in every gnostic
theory the Demiurge worked out the plens of the Supreme,
but it was in a spirit of dense ignorance.

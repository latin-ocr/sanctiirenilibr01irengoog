,Ϊζωξῗζ to it. Plato affirmed something of the same kind, when

hc said that ¹“ to discover the Creator of the universe is a
work of difficulty, but to bring him within the cognizance
of all, impossible.” In the Theaetetus, indeed, the subject
of which is a discussion of the question, “what is know·
ledge ?'’ three principal theorica are advanced and refute'd,
without arriving at any positive solution to the question;
yet the overthrow of these theories only proves the earn·
estness with which each of the three teechers, Heraclitus,
Protagoras, eud Theaetetus had claimed for their respec-
tive systems an exclusive origin from the lountain-head of
knowledge. ’Elsewhere a truc γνῶσις is identified with
an intellectuat, that is at the same time inseparable from a
moral perception of the Divine Principle. In Persia,
⁴Zoroaster asserted a still more losty principle, in engaging
his followers to an intellectual abstraction from the world
ol matter. The very name yvdorrror is a translation rather
of the ⁵0riental synonyma for φιλόσοφος, than a term of
indigenous growth‚ and marked the votary of esoteric
knowledge; while the union of the spiritual principle in
man with the Divine substance, was the γνῶσις with which
it professed to deal, and represented that contemplative
abstraction of the faculties of the soul, und eustatie union
with the Divine Principle, thet has always been the great
ochct of aspiration to the Easteru devotee; and that
formed so marked a feature in the ‘neoPlatonic School
of Alexandria.

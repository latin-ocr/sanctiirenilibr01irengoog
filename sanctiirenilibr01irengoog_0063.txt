the margin of this intermediate void3 Aristotle's subtlety -“““

fusion of philosophical schools, in the eclectio system of
Alexandria, to resolve the difficulty, negatively‚ by deny-
ing that there was any such void to be bridged over, and
positively, by asserting the complete oncness of Truth with
the Intellect. Plotinus expressed only the theory of hisp. 'ml

of conception?¹ 'in his words ουκ ἔξω τοῦ νοῦ τὰ νοητά.
Porphyry disputed the position, not because it wasroesu
novel or strange, but tbat he might draw out the
master upon a subjectos philosophie interest. Thus tbe
absolute unity of the Thinking Mind with the entities
that it conceives, was one great distinguisbing tenet of
the Alexandrian or Neo-Platonis school of philosopby3
and it very evidently coincided with the notion of the
Gnostic heresiarcbs, that s true γνῶσις csn only subolet in
souls that by a divine insemination are derived from and
retum to the κόσμος vostris, tbe Pleroma of Intelligeuce.

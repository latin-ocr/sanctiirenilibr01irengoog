the captives of Israel. The songs of Zion sung by the Early
waters of Babylon with mourning hearts, awakened kin· rffiw
dred thoughts in a sister race.. The oracles of life could “-
hardly have been explained in the vernaculor language of
Babylon, without becoming known to thousands along the
whole course of tha Euphrates. So, again, portione of
Chaldaic lore contained ln the Talmud and the Gabbala, .
shew that the sources of those traditione, superstitious and
puerile as they may appear as compared with the Word of
Life, were not wholly idolatrous. The two systems were to
some extent amalgamated; the J cwish ¹theology borrowcd
from the Chaldee ¹theosophy and became Cabbalistic, while
the Chaldee sages obtained from the law and the propheta
higher notione of the Supreme Being. Hence the daughter
of Zion was scarcely distinguished by careless observers
from the daughter of Babylon; the two were treated as of {yffi-ht·
one faith; so the oracular verses assent,
Μοῦνοι Χαλδαῖοι σοφίην λα’χον ἧδ’ ‹ip' Ἑβραῖοι,
2Αιῖτογένητον ἄνακτα σεβαζόμενοι dedu ἁγνῶς.
Even the well informed ascribed a common origin to the m
Jews and to the Magi. From the period of this close con· n ’
tact with a race of purer saith, in the captivity, the belief
and sacred philosophy of Chaldaea, though mixed up with
astrology, became lixed; and Diodorus Siculus testifica to nana
the steadiness wherewith its sagas adhered to the intellec·
tual system received from their fathers, while the schools
of Graece were drilbing from one novel phase to another.

The reader will observa, however, that the Chaldee omnes.
sagas of primitive times are not to be confounded with Μῶα
the Χαλδαῖοι, of whom Hrrronvrus speaks among other
precursors of Gnosticism. Tha term, as used by the

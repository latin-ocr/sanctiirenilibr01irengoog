The analogies afforded by the theories of Pisto ure
striking3 perhaps portione of his system, thet reflect the
greatest light upon the Valentinisn heresy, originally

Mau-¹2 ceme from ²Egypt. Hence Hrrronrrus says of it; η’ μὲν
οὖν ἀρχῆ τῆς inediocris ἔστιν η’ e'u τῷ Τιμαίῳ roc Πλάτωνος
σοφία 8Αἰγυπτίων. The points of Pleto’s teschiug with
which we are chiefly concerned, cre, his theory of the Divine
ἰδέαι, end his views respecting the materici world end the
mundane soul; which suggested on the one hand, the sys-
tem oi AEons within the Pleroma, aud on the other, the ex·
ternel world of Valentinus without it; while the imitative
process by which ull things creste were mede the counter·
part of eternelly subsisting heevenly types, both in the
Pletonic and Gnostic theories, plainly marks thct the latter
were formed upon models iurnished by the greut mester
of philosophy. Now in several points connected with
these three mein topics, e very remsrkeble coincidence
may he observed between the doctrine of Pisto end the
Egyptian theories detsiled by Plutarch end Ismhlichus3
end o community oi origin, so fer us these resemblances

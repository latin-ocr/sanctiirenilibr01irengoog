Pron-bre apologises for his roughness of style, as betraying tbe con-
AE'ss- scions imperfectiora of a writer, whois not handling his
own vernacular language, and hardly feels at home with
the idioma, that force of circumstances has compelled him
to adopt. If Greek had been bis native tangue, there
would have been little danger that his style should be de-
based through barbarian contact3 and since be was neither
of Gallio nor of Italian extraction, the probability is
strengthened by this ¹ expression, that he was born in
Syria, and having been instructed as a child in some
sarman. Syriae version of Scripture, was removed during the years
of boyhood to Smyrna. ’
The date of our author’s birth is also unknown The
only clue we possess is the statement that in his boyhood,
· - παῖς clv ἔτι, he remembered Floriana as a fellow-hearcr of
Polycarp. Floriana was, doubtless, his senior, for he
speaks of him as a person of some mark, and of courtly
statur, λαμπρῶς πράττοντα ἕν τῇ βασιλικῇ αὐλῇ, and more
anxious perhaps, than a mere youth would have been, to
ingratiate himself with the venerable bishop Polycarp.
But in his letter to Florinus he speaks of himself as is
usual with the elderly, and says that be bas a more vivid
recollection of events that passed before him as a bey,
than of those that bad occurred more recently. At the time
therefore of writing this epistle to Florinus, Irenoeus was
not less perhaps than sixty years of age. The tone also
of the extract from his ¹letter to Victor, Bisbop of Rome,
attha same period, marks rather the experienced Bishop,
addressing himself to a brother whose prefsrmcnt to an
important see was of recent date. Irenaeus would scarcely
have thought it necessary to stimulate the vigilance of
Victor afler the prompt condemnation of Theodotus ao.

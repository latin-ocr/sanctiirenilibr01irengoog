of his ideas was derived by Plato from the definitione of
his master Socrates, or more remotely from the Pytha-
gorean harmony of numbers, or even from sources of
a yet higher antiquity; still in their ultimate form they
were a creation of the wonderful intelligenoe of Plato3
and the nearer approximation that he made in other
respects ιο inspired Truth, only made it more certain
that bis would bs the system singled out by heresy as
its exemplar.

In its cruder form then the doctrine of divine ἰδέαι

of more primitive times. The notion is in fact inse-
parable from belief in the existence of an eternal and
forecasting Divine Intellect. lamblichus, as a Neo·
Platonist, would hardly have expressed himself in such
a way, as to imply that the founder of his philosophy
followed the Egyptian teaching with respect ιο the
ideology of things create, if he had not felt very certain
of his ground. He accounts for the symbolical character
of the Egyptian religious system, by saying, that it was
intended to symbolice the Divina ideas veiled beneath
forms of matter1. The goddess isis herself was the per-
soniiication of the same notiou²; and if we had the means
of following the theory back to ita more remote source, we
should in all probability trace it to the great emporium of
intellectual as well as of commercial antiquity‚ ou the
bauks of the Euphrates3 it was a live ember perhaps from

altars of a yet more remote period.

Anni- his own person, when he said, fibulas Mioatm....aqaam

Ἢ dicit esse initium reram Deum autem mentem eom, qaoe aa
aqua coneto fingeret. The deity of Thales appears to have
been nothing else than the vital or plastis energy, that he
conceived to be inherent in the elementary particles of
water.

Anaximander, with whom Pythagoras is said to have
spoken, first identified the term ἀπειρία with bis fnst prin·
ciple or ᾰρχῆ, a term that was ¹incorporated by him in the
philosophical terminology 3 but his ἀρχή was physical,
being the 'vital principle of creation, and the ἀπειρία of
which he spoke, is described ιο us by Aristotle and
Theophrastus, as the ³intermingling of various hetero-
geneous constituent partiales, the aggregation of which
was requisite for the formation of individusl substance,

Prdnm‘priie propri& seraper rea quasque errori,
simula qai quosdam sontes demovit habere
AEternam ineptos, oc rarum semine plenos.

Brucker, however, gives him credit for intending some
such infinite immaterial principle, as the 310'1'8 of Cab-
ιο balistis theology. His pupil Anaximenes, adopting the
same term, applied it to the element of air, with him the
source of all. The two preceding principles were here
superseded, and a morerere and impalpable clement was
declared to be the true basis of the physical system.
Philosophy was ιο a certain degree sublimated, and¹
releascd from its thraldom ιο grosser material principles.
At the same time, that which in preceding systema had
been a mere vital energy‚ received gradually a higher
development, and philosophy by degrees learned to refer
the orderly arrangement of matter in the physical crea·
tion to one Supreme designing Mind

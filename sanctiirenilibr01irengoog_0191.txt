They add that no Codex was missing from the list of the Βω-

1111752 Pfaff gave an account of his discovery in the
N. Aeto Eruditorom, published at Leipsic. He found the

that the printed books were now separate from the MSS.
But so little store was set by them, that a serious intention

collection, with the exception of a Tabula Isiaco, aud the
volumes of Pyrrhus Ligarius! Pfaff then continues to tell
his readers, that aceess was at first allowed, and permission
given to make whatever extracta be pleased from these
MSS. omnis perte-ris, queis literoe maaime socroe asperi pos-
sint, but afterwards these facilities were restricted, (non

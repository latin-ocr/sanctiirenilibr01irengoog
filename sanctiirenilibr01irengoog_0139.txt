time. Though lPhilo does not use the term, the same idea Q
is couveyed by his λόγος, dovensis, ἰδέαι, nni. We may

take nido therefore, in the Valentinian acceptatiou of the

word, to mean an emanation from the Divine substance,
subsisting coordinately aud co-eternally with the Deity,
ss distinct 'hd-yon, the Pleroma still remaining one.

Τὴο system of Valentinus, from abundant iuterusl
proof, is seen to have consisted of thirty AEons3 but the
theory was uot spun wholly from his own brnin3 he bor-
rowed from older sources, principally indeed from Basi-
lides, but also from the ophite, or ⁸Gnostie properly so
called. Then, again, his system almost immediately di·
varicated into an ⁴Eastern aud Western branch of the
sams stock3 so that we may naturally expect to find state-
ments in detail, that ure not quite consistent with esch
other. Tshing therefore the thirty AEons as a known
quantity, there arises the doubt whether Bythus and Sige
st the commeueement, or Christ and the Spirit st the con·
elusion, are to he eliminated. Hippolytus adopts, very
expressly, the former alternative, and henaeus partially
confirms his statements. Bythus, ⁶he says, stood eingly
and alone, and was the Monadic source of the entire Ple-
roma, from which, in fact, he was distinct; a primsry Horue

ex VALENTINUS.

Η·ο congru. the early part of the second century, moditied by the
—emanational theory of the East; and so far as the religious
element was embodied ιιι it, dignified with certain leading

ternas and traditione os the Christian Religion. It is by
no means asserted that this description is applicable to
the sect for any length of time from the founder. lt
disappeared in all probability hy attraction of its elementa
on the one hand, towards the more poetical system of
Valentinus, and on the other, towards the neo-Platonic
opinions with which many principles were held in common.

¹Valcntinus was an Egyptian, as Epiphanius states, of
the Phrebonitic nome; after receiving full Christian in·
struction, he lapsed from the saith, and amalgamating
together Catholic truths with various principles of the
Gnostic philosophy of his day, produced the system from
him called the Valentinian heresy. The usc that this
heretic and his followers made of scripture, plainly shews
that he had no superficial acquaintance with the Christian
doctrines. In Egypt he was still not only nominally of thc
Chnrch, hut, if Epiphanius may be creditcd, a 'tenchea If
he had continued at Alexandria, possibly he might have
remained in comparative obscurity‚ and the five books of
henaena, containing as they do information upon thc Church
system and doctrine of the earliest period, that is of in-
calculable velue, would never have been written. But he
transferred his teaching to Rome, about 140 aa, where
heresy as yet had never taken root; and he was soon
deposed from his order, if he had ever been admitted to
any sacred function, and expelled the Church⁸. He then
retired to Cyprus, the head quarters of his heresy; but re-
visited Rome on more than one occasion.

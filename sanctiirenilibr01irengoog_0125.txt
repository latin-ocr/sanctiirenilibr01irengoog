BASILIDES. ev

a principle ¹dependent partly upon nois, partly upon morunt.
ψνχή. Basilides then was a tencher of philosophy rather ’-
than of religion. uhodone wide point of distinction must
always separate this heresiaroh from every other Gnostic
toacher, which was the very decided way in which, having
accepted and moulded to his purpose certain traditional
results of philosophy, he discouraged all attempta at apecu-
lation ’in matters far beyond the province of human rea
son. Even ³things heavenly were only imperishable so
long as they remained within their proper sphere; to trans
gress was to be destroyed; and man could plead no
exemption from the universal law. On the other hand,

we may trace in Basilides the hardy sels-dependent spirit

of philosophy, which, denying every οροοίοἰ interserence of

the Divine principle, asserted the tendency os all rational
Being to improve itself, and to advance from good to
better3 only his rational νἰότης was elect by nature, and its
advantages were limited to one particular class, as was the
case in the theories of Saturninus and of Valentinus next

to be considered. It was in the same spirit of saith in
strength growing up from below, and os man’s perfect-
ibility, that the son os Demiurge, and of the superior
ἅρχων, were both represented as of a higher degree of ,
excellence than their respective sires.

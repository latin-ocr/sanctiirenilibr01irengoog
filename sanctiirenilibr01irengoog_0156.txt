cxxxvi VALENTINUS.

Demiurge. Achamoth therefore haring now received her formo-
* tion κατὰ γνῶσιν, originated those spiritual powers of
inferior gredo, thot were no longer considered too subtle
for intermixture with the gross essence of matter.- These

’ were, Demique, ¹fiery oe the first matter of Plato, formed
efter the image of Monopeneo or Nur by the coopero-
tion of Sotorr ond the wnrious engelic end archangelic
counterparts of the AEone3 these eleo peopled the psychic
habitat of Demiurge, constituting the seven astronomicel
heriveus, or ’Hebdomon or Άνᾰπαυσις, ond in which the
souls of the faithful ond elect ore reserved os in o plnoe
of rest3 3τῷ Ἀβραὰμ καὶ τοῖς λοιποῖς bonoloco τοῖς e’v τῇ
ἀναπαύσει οὖσιν ἐν τοῖς δεξιοῖς· Both the psychici or dectral,
and the hylle or moirti-al principle were embodied in form
by Demiurge3 the first being anologoue to the formation
of the mundone soul in the Timaeus, while the consolido-
tion of the second represented the Platonic sillingos oppo-
site clemente, κου’φων roi βαρεῶν, ἀνωφερῶν καὶ κατωφερῶν.
There is also ociose ratio to be'observed between this
portion ὀἷ the Valentininn ond of the Platonic theories,
and Achamoth wne to her hypostatised πάθη, ns the ⁴creo-
tor deities of Plato were to the first motter3 also, Acho-
moth with these various πάθη, was to Bython, ne the
Platonio creatore with the first matter, were to the Su-
preme. So, again, e definite onalogy moy be traced
between rte three relations of the Divine Principle in the
later Pletonio idea, and tho triple progressior of Valenti-

elder it rnled the younger or bodlly Adrou, the impmonntion of the 'Di-

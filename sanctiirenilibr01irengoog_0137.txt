in speaking of the Pythagorean arithmetica} mysticism, mintho
thus sums tha decad, τό *γὰρ ἓν, δύο, τρία, τέσσαρα *γίνεται Effiff

δέκα, ὁ τέλειος ἀριθμός, which was perfect, as foreclosingQ
tbe series of nnita, all succeeding numeration being carried ¹'·¹⁶⁷·
on by combining the seli-same unita with a decad. It
should be added, however, that Hippolytus also describes
the decad, in the Pythagorean theory, as symbolising ma·
terial substance 1ηνίυα its nine accidente. This group then,
citherae having a dynamio existence in tha Tetrad, was in-
tercalated between the Ogdoad and the Dodecad; or the
five Egyptian deities that were intercalated to bring the
twelve lunar months of thirty days into agreement with
the solur year, may have furnishcd the basis of the Decad,
each terrn, as in the evolution of the Opdoad from the
Tetrad‚ having been united in συζυγία with some other
correlative term. The Dodecad, in the more ancient
system, was in all probability zodiaca13 but in the Valen-
tinian scheme it expressed tbnt imitative progression that
was of tbe very essence of this theory. Thus, aa in arith- nm·
metical notation, each successive Decad is incr-cased by
units of addition, so the Valentinian Decad having been
completed, was re-commenced by nn initial pair; and in
the same way that Bytbus and Sige preceded the Pleroma

of Intelligibles, the pair now added to the Decad to
form the Dodecad, hended the world of Sensibles; and
stood midway between the world of Intellcct that they
soreclosed and the world of Matter that was next evolved.
Valentinus, therefore, may bave borrowed the rough out-
line of hie system from theold mythology of Egypt, but

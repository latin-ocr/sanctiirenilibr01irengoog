So the faith that Cecrops, whether as an autochtlwa or nmen„
as a foreigner, imported from Egypt, before the birth ofq‘fflffi
Moses, was belief in the unity of the Divine Principle‚ if Q
it was the saith of Sais the political origin of Athennffiss ⁰¹·
and it was lixed, no doubt, in those whose thirst for know-
ledge led them back ιο the banhs of the Nile. Still
Egypt was the nursing mother of Polytheism, and no
doubt Hnnonorus tells us truly, that the names of the
gods in Greek mythology, “hourly conceived and hourly 101„ m„

These names however expressed, either different pheses of
the creature world, or different attributes and manifestations
of the one Eternal. Thus Athene may have been Νηιθ,
and identified with Isis; but this name merely signified
the Divina Wisdom aa manifested in creation. Poseidon,
or, as he was called in the Etruscan mythology, Neptune,
may have been Nephthys of the Egyptian; but the
poetical appellation of ἐννοσίγαιος is more applicable
perhaps to the Egyptian, than to the Pelasgia deity, as
typifying the perrhhablc5 and Nephthys was ιο the dark and
motiouless and dead, what Isis was to the world of light
and energy and lise. So again Osiris was in one aspect
Neilos or ¹Helios, in another 'Oceanus but in power the
Egyptian deity was the causative origin of all. The very
divergenoe that is observable in the varying powers and
attributes of the prototypes of Greek mythology still .
indicates a centre of unity: the account of Hnnonorus
may be true, and yet the ancient creed of Egypt need not
have been polytheistic. Whatever the priests of On and
Memphis taught the loose rabble to believe, their own
saith we may assume to have been ot' no low or debased
type, when we lind the best and wisest of the Greeks for

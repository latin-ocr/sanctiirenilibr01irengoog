SOUBOES or GNOSTIOISM. ll

bers3 also that these two lines of philosophie thought

converge and meet in Egyptian theorias, such as have ΡΜ

already been described¹. Evidently the power and energy
of the mundane soul was indicated in Egyptian myths as
well as in the Platonis theory. The entire system indeed
of Egyptian mythology rested upon deified principles and
powers of nature, of which Oreuzer has given a closely
detailed account in his Symbolilr aad Mytiolopia. If there-
fore it should be found in the Gnostic, and more specially
in the Valentinian system, that the world was animated by
a quasi Divina soul, the notion as originating in Egypt may
have been the result of fusion of Egyptian and Platonic
theories. The connexion however between the Pleroma
of Valentinus, with its correlative external Hebdomad‚
and anything similar in the Platonic system, is reserved
for future consideration.

One more particular may be mentioned as observable
in the language of Plato. He continually speaks of the
creative act as a μίμησις, having reference to that nnity
of design that formed one of the characteristic attributes
of his ideas. The analogice for instance of comparative
anatomy would in his language be referred to the imitativa
principle. Thus the Demiurge having caused divine
mances to exist, delegated to thern the work of creating
mortal substance3 and by an imitativa act, ’oi tt μιμού-
μενοι, they embodied the divine sonl in its material ὄχημα.
Again, the same divine creative essences³ formed the
head of man of a shape that should correspond with the

periphery of the universe, τὸ τοῦ πόντος σχῆμα ἀπομιμησά-
μενοι περιφερὲς ὅν. The entire material world was buta

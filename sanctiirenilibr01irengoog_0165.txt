the Zend Avesta. Like Plato, Valentinus aoknowledges a Intraum
higher spiritual principle, as well as the mere psychic soul Q
of the animae like his master also, he leaves the origin
of matter wrapped in mist and obscurity, though he seems
to have taught that grues matter had its origin in time,
while the space that it was to occupy, its ideal forms,
tendencies, and general characteristica were eternal. The
Valentinian AEons have been very generally referred to
the ἰδέαι of Plato, and in several particulare they harmoniae
more closely with the viena of the great master, than with
the ideas of the neo-Platonic school; the AEone of the
Pleroma and the idea os the Universe, as it subsisted in
Achamoth, together, are not nidcly different from the
ideal entities of Plato.

The imitative principle, that Valentinus adopted from oraora.

¹more ancient systema of philosophy, is an idea of perpetual

, recurrence. ‘The entire universe was held together by

mimetic links. Eaeh emanation was a copy of the pre-
ceding, and a model for after development. Thus Bythos

ἵ was reflected in Monogenes or Nur, and the two hya pro·

portionate development became the Tetrad,· this summed
with its units the Decod, when a fresh series commenced,
and the accession of another initial pair constituted the
Dedecod. Various instances of this reproduction will be

notieed in the account of Irenaeus. The same mode of
thought is perceptible in Plato. The writings of Philo p. arna

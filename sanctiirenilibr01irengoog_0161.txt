the spiritual, animal, and material, and it mattered little, ffi
practically, that there was an antecedent ideal Adam. The ””““
seed of the elect was the counterpart of the heavenly
Ecclesia, the Church forcordained from everlasting in the

The Christology of Valentinus was essentially Docetic. aa.
The heresiarch imagined again a four-fold constitution for
his Christ3 and in lieu of the body of flcsh, or hylle prin-

TheValentinian view of the destiny of the human race,
bore a considerable resemblance to the Manichoean theory
of Indefectibility, which has descended to us as the Supra-
lapsan'an theory of Predestinatioa. Of the three classes

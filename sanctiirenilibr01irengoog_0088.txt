-ζ acted not otherwise, but seeing Him she hid withinherself
the Father‚ which is the Power; thus Thought also is a
bisexual Power, so that in this way they mutually cor-
respond3 for Power differs iu no respect from Thought,
being One. Power is found to be from above, Thought
from beneath. It is thus that the manifestation also ema·
nating from them being One, is found to be Tv0; the
Bisexual that hatlr within Himself the Female. He is
Mind in Thought. Being One inseparably from each
other, they are virtually Two.”

We may observa iu this passage a very definite sa·
sertion of the Oriental emanative principle. The Deity,
One and lnscrutable, is described aa putting forth a certain
Power or quality, that was substantially reabsorbed, and
identified with the Divine essence. The dark saying of
Heraclitus, p. xxxv, may have been indicative of this
theory. The Brahmiuical simile of the tortoise putting
forth, and withdrawing its limbs from beneath the mm,
at the present day, exemplifies it. But with greater subtle-
ty, the Samariten Mage drew his illustration from that,
which is at once the loftiest exponent of Power upon
earth, the highly composite system of a most perfect
Unity, the Mind of Man. Another particular, that should
be observed in the passage quoted, serves to illustrate the
rationale of the Valentiniau series of AEons; which is the
meaning, pregnaut with the co-ordinate, of each successive
term that it contains: so νοῦς and ἐπίνοια are present
throughout as the theme; and the Past-Preseut-Future
is embosomed in them; ιφωνή also and ὄνομα evolve the
nameof Father; and λογισμός and ἐνθύμησις complete the
series, as the action aud reactiou of Mind in Thought,
and Thought in Mind. The Valentiniau system, though
numerically different, is determined by the same limits3

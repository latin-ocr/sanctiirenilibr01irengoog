Enthyme- notion as it arises may be referred with a tolerabledegree

Q of certainty to its origin, sometimes in the Oriental
theosophy, sometimes in the Jewish (labbala, but sar
more frequently in the Greek philosophy.

We turn now to a scarcely less abstruse subject the
Valentinian account of the Orestion of the world. It may
be premised that it agrees neither with the philosophical
notion that metieris eternal, simply because nothing can
come of nothing; nor with the later Oriental view, that
matter is the matrix of the evil principle, eternally coex-
isting with supreme good,¹ and contending for the mastery;

. on the contrary, Bythos, in the beginning, was a solitary
abstractiou, and it was only after many successive emana-
tions, that ¹matter was brought to the birth. There was a
recognition of the Eastern principle, so far as it was
thought impossible that gross matter should be evolved
immediately from that which is purely spiritual substanee;
but virtuslly the Mosaic account was adopted, that God
created the Heaven and Earth, and all the pancratiaste of

1'vva' them; and so far, as we have seen, the Bssilidian system
also agreed. The Valentinian theory then exhibite the
following notions. In the first place 'Love was the impul·
sive principle that caused the emission of the Only-begot
ten Νοῦς, and Ἀλήθεια, and a Divine ³e'vfiuporc was its
mode. But *thea was the substance in which Νοῦς was
evolved; sud that which in Bythus was an impulsiva Love,
developing itself in the Divine conception, was ⁵engendered

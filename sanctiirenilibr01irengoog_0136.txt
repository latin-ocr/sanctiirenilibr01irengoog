vam ἄνθρωπος was borrowed from the Adam Cadmca of the
⁹530&ss casnm through the menium of munos wessaga, mon-

ing the arrhenothete ideal of the human nuces and bya

further prosecution of the same notion‚ Bythus himself,

in certain offsets of the Valentinian stock, was termed

'dvdpurroa as having been the primary exemptor, after which

man vves formed κατ’ εἰκόνα. The Tetrad therefore with

the correlative feminine terms formed the ogdoad. But

the Egyptian deities‚ as we have seen, were divided into

,ι v. three groups. The primary order, as Herodotus has

informed us, consisted of eight deities; and a certain

harmonical proportior subsisting between these groups

justifies the inference that they were originally based upon

definite geometrical analogies, and that Valentinus adopted

from the Egyptian theosophy the same numericul mysti

cism, that several ages previously had suggested to Pytha·

goras one principal feature of his philosophy. As there·

fore the second group of twelve deities emanated from

the primary Ogdoad in theold Egyptian mythology, so in

the Valentinian system the Deoud first was evolved from

the ogdoad, and the Dodecod from the Decnd. But the
analogyis only general, and must not be strained. The '

triple division of the entire system, and the co-existeuce

of an Oydood and a Dedecori, ns also the principle of emana-

tion of one series from a preceding element, is all that is

adduoed‚ but this is sufficient to connect the Valentiniau

with the Egyptian method of progression. With regard

to the Decod, this too was evolved from the Tetrad, bui

w by a different process. Here the numeriosl value of the

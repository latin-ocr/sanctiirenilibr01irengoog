assy venerable Bishop of Portus, means simply an astrologer,

affin one who was generally an adept also in magicnl delusione,

“““““““ the Chaldaeans of Croeso cadruvium, [Sat. vi. 552]:

chamon sed major erit fiducia: quioquid
Diceris aaronque, madent a sonte relatam
Ammonis: qnoniam Delphis oracula cassant,
Et penas hamanum dammi calipo fiatri.

popam Annus Gnnmus identifies the term with Mathematicus,

while Haeremus, speaking of them with greater respect

than they deserved, defines the Χαλδαῖοι ns, ’γένος μάγων

sappam πάντα γινωσκόντων. The Peratae or Gnostic fatallsts

{ig-,y originated from nese canamus, and wan the name pre-

{iffi} tended to have derived their doctrines also from the
highest antiquity.

0f the early Persian theosophy we have as little cer·

tain knowledge as of the Chaldaeam but we now find

ourselves within range of regular history. At the close of

rutrum the J ewish captivity, Cyrus the Persian, the Lord’s Shep-

hercl, makes a clear profession of saith in one Supreme

mam God, in his edict for rehuilding the Temple; ondit was in

a similar spirit thot, before he engaged the forces of

Croesus, he invoked‚ not the gods ns a body, but ¹One All-

{ww powerful Delty, ἑψόμεθά σοι, ὦ Ζεῦ μέγιστε. He had pro-

ἰ’ fited possibly by collision with men of a purer worship, and

eliminated from his belief in the Deity many elements that

were inconsistent with right resson. So again his lan-

guage respecting the ’sonl's immortality, half believing half

doubting, argues indeed no very accurate conception of

things eternal, but, such ns it is, it is expressed in a manner

that shows a fixed belief in the existence of Divine bene·

volence as a principle of unity. Thus his hope isfor the

{1⁴12ss future, μηδὲν ἂν ἔτι κακόν παθεῖν, μήτε ἣν perd τοῦ θείου

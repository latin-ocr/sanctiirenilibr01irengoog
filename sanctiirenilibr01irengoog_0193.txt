Upon the doctrine of lrenaeus it is not necessary to saumana

say many words. With few exceptione, and those not at siffis,

all dependent upon doetrinal discrepencies, the Anticles ff

of the Chureh of England might be illustrated singly
from the statement of Irenaeus. The Index will enable
each render to do this for himself. The subjectos the
Holy Eucharist alone has given rise to expressions that
need a few words of explanation.

First, 1 presume that a comparison of the several
passages in the work c. Haereses, that have reference to
this subject, with the Fragment xxxva, can throw no
doubt whatever upon the genuineness of that Fragment3
they present the same Catholic object of Faith to us in

γ two different phasea. In the work c. Hoer. the subject of
the Eucharist is advanced in opposition to the views
respectively, of (1) the ¹Marcionite, who denied that the
creation and the good gifts of God stored up init, are the
work of the Supreme Deity, or of the Divine Word; and
(u) of the Valentinian, who affirmed that they were a
produci of ignorance and abortion. In either case there
was great disparagement of the Creator's works3 and the
author introduces the mention of the Eucharist in course
of his argument, not that he may explain the nature of
that Sacrament, but that he may illustrate his reasoning
from the known Catholic teaching of the Church, that the
Body and Blood of Christ are verily and indeed taken
and received by the faithful in the Lord’s Supper. - How,
therefore, should heresy declara that the Bread which
Christ himself consecrated as His Body, and the Cup
which He blessed as His Blood, are the creatures not of

¹ the Word, nor of God the Father, but of some sub-
ordinate Demiurge, half malignant and wholly ignorant?
No one, Ι think, will read the statements noted below

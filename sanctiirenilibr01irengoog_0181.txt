τραῦσι τὴν ἡμέραν αὐτῶν. Considerable discussion has
arisen with respect to the punctuation of this passage,
whether τεσσαράκοντα should be disjoined or not from
ὥρας. ¹Bellermine considered that Irenaeus was not speak-
ἵ ing of that conventional kind of fasting, which admitted of
solution, more Judaico, in the evening, but of rigid and
total abstinence from food; he therefore removed the
comma, and interpreted τὴν ἡμέραν as consisting of the
two days preceding the Feast of the Resurrection, or the
sorty hours during which our Lord remained under the
hand of death. Valesius, in his notes upon Eusebius, pro
poses to substitute νηστείαν for ἡμέραν, but the suggestion
is without authority, nnd therefore inadmissible. Grabe
interprete ἡμέραν indefinitely as time, sensnm which, as
Mossuet observes, is not more satisfactory3 ond he then
proposes to replaoe the comma, and to take the words
according to their plain grammatical meauing; i. e. some
oquin continue thesostsbr sorry days, computinp ench day as

not involve total abstinence from food, but permitted the
use of breed, salt, fish, and even fowl; the two latter

quotations indeed will not justify the conjecture that
Hippolytus was the friend, at whose instance the work
was written, for the chronology cf the two writers
makes the supposition wholly untenable3 Hippolytus
must have been as young, when the work was written
c. Haereses, as Irenaeus was when he heard Polycarp.
If this work were written before an. 190, we know
that Hippolytus was in his ¹vigour un. 250, when 'he
wrote against N cetus. He may have received instruc-
tion therefore from Irenaeus3 buthe ean scarcely have
suggested to him the need of such a work as that now
before us. These are questions however that belong
rather to the Life of Ireuaeus in a subsequent page.
‘The appearance of the invaluable work of Hippoly-
tus rendered it necessary that many of our ideas upon
the Gnosticising heresies of the first two centuries
should be readjusted; and that some systematis ac-

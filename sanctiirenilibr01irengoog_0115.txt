¹Neander was oi the same opinion, though not always so nevam
positively. Baur also follows the same lead; and there affl ,
no reason why 'doubt should be throwu upon these mo-
dern deductione from ancient statements. Only it should
be borne in mind that all these heresies affected to revert
to opinions and theories that were anterior to all contem·
porary systems of philosophy; and, as we have seen, the
old Persian theory, like the Pythagorean, was Moaods‘c,
but, like that system, exhibited a secondary development
of contending principles3 Basilides therefore may ³very
consistently have asserted his belief in one Supreme Prin·
ciple, by whatever negative name he might call it, and
yet have symbolised with the general teaching of the
East as regards a coordinate antagonism of Good and
Evil. The latter, like the ivdiuoon of the Valentinian
Pleroma, may have had its rise iu tbis theory so soon as nn.
the evolution of divine attribute gave rise to the notion of
relation.

The world when it was created was ἐξ οὐκ ὄντων, and in
this term we need scarcely reeognise the Platonio distinction
of the nonentity of shifting variable matter, as compared
with the eternal invariable Being of the Deity3 because
Plato extended the same definition to every prodnet of
metten whereas tbe heretic nowhere describes the out·
ward world as nir ὥν. But the Deity created the universe {lgm

from things nonexlslent3 'cirros οὖκ niv Oedi· ἐποίησε κόσμον,

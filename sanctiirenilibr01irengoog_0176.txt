Ἢ bilities of his ordinatiou3 whether he received his divine
commission at the hands of Pothinus, or of some other
bishop. Neither is it a very material consideration, in a
controversiul point of view, whether or nothe wos conse-
crutcd as successor to Pothinus by the Bishop of Rome3
forthere was no other Gallicou sec at this period than
that of Lyons, ¹ss the 'Benedictine establishcs3 it was by
necessity therefore, and not in consideration of the potior
principalitas, that the ohurch ol Lyons, in such a case,
would apply to Rome for the consecration ol' a successor
to its martyred bishop. Whether he was scut to Rome
for the express purpose of consecration, is, to say the least,
doubtful. Certainly he was charged with o letter to
Rome by certain leading membcrs of the Cburoh of
Lyons, who awaited in prison their crown of martyrdom;
but the substance of the letter sent was ἐἰρήνης iveta: il'
it bad been intended as the expression os a wisb that the
bearcr should be consecrated bishop, the wish would have
been conveyed in less enigmatical terma, than these upon
which Massuei builds his theom troi παρακαλοῦμεν ἔχειν

But Hippolytus either drawa the veil of charity bver the mosyes
more secret working of Gnosticism, or in Italy its votaries Q
lived, si aon caste conte tamea, and paid a greater regard
to appearances than in the provinces; for it is remarkable
that the Bishop of Portus, following as he so frequently
does the account of Irenoeus‚ and transcribing long extracts,
stops short at these charges of immorality; as though he
could not bear witness to the trnth of the picture, so far as
it had been presented to his own personal observation,
amid the realities of life. One very remarkable feature iu
the work of S. Hippolytus, is the care that he takes not to
sully his page with topios that it must always pain the
Christian tc read. For this reason we also may omit
those details upon Valentinian and Marcosian immoralitics‚
that followed in natural course from their ideas of inde-
fectible privilege.
The Valentinian view οἲ inspiration was quite consistent
with the rest of the system. For the government and
disposition of the affairs oi life were wholly under the
gnidance of Demiurge, whose prolound ignorance of every
thing above his sphere prevented him from having any know·
ledge of the spiritual substance imparted by Achamoth;
upon the principle indicated hythe Apostle, ψυχικὸς δὲ 1001. n u
ἅνθρωπος od δέχεται ‘rd τοῦ πνεύματος τοῦ Θεοῦ. There was
something, however, intrinsically beautiful in the spiritual
principle that commended it to his regard3 and those into
whom it was intused were advsnced by him to pre-emi·
nance, as Prophets, Priests, and Kings. But the spirits of
the prophets though subject to the propheta, were no
subjecte of the Demiurge3 hence they uttered indifferently
that which was dictated by Achamoth, as in the sugges·
tione of the seed they bore within, as well as the psychic
and merely natural ideas that their human soul derived },⁰2{,·'¹'²b

them3 th'e former being the type of dawn'ing light, the opulus
latter of a world shrouded in darkness. Christ, therefore, J-
quoai deutrum, et iu superiora allevatitium, emanated from
a redundant overfiow of the Divine Light, and in conjunc·
tion with the triple source of his subsistenoe formed the rua
prototypal Ecclesia of the Highest Heaven.

The mundane Sophia or Nus, finding no rest either in
heaven or earth, invoked 'the help of the Maternal spirit,
and obtained from the First Man, or Incorruptible AEon,
that Christ should be sent to her aid, and being united nm
with her, should hya combined descent upon J esus at his

baptism, form that Ecclesia on earth, which had an eternal
counterpart in the union of Christ with the Father, Son,

and Spirit in heaven. The συζυγία of Christ and Sophia
thus united with J esus, left him again upon his crucifixion,
and the populiis Man alone suffered death and was buried3
Christ however raised J esus again from the dead, in a body r. aa
that was animal and spiritual, but not eheie or eur-thy.
Finally, those “ holy souls” that had been endued with the
gift of Light were received by Christ seated at the right
hand of Jaldabaoth, when released from the body; while aaa
the merely animal souls were sent back again into the world
for further purification. The false gospel of the Infancy
of Christ may have been intended by the writer to meet
the Ophite assertion that J esus performed no miracle
either before his Baptism or after his resurrection, that is, um.
while separate from the AEon Christ; although the draught
of tishes recorded by S. John, e. xxi, was evidently
regarded by the disciples as miraculous.

We may observe in this tissue of absurdity the distort-
ed outline of one or two important Christian doctrines.

nnuc water-y clement, Anaxagoras resolved the combination, and
&assigned ιο aa neit, aa independens aetion in ane napa
sition and government of all things. ιΝοῐιο διακοσμῶν was
with him a moral as well as an intellectual principle, ’Ἀναξα-
γόρας δὲ als κινοῦν τό ἀγαθόν ἀρχήν· όγόρ nafis κινεῖ, α’λλιὶ
κινεῖ ἔνεκό τινος· end the source of τό καλοκαγαθόν, as
Aristotle again reeorde; ’πολλαχοῦ μὲν γὰρ τό αἴτιοντοῦ
καλῶς καὶ ὀρθῶς τόν νοῦν λέγει, though he still made a
certain confusion between νοῦς and the vital principle ψυχή,
affirming τόν νοῦν εἶναι τόν αὐτόν τῇ ψυχῇ. F or the ap·
proximation however that he made to the truth, J osarnus
speaks of him with the same terma of praise as Pytha

indeed, that at Athens some similarity was traced between

his Material and Immaterial Principles, and the dualistic
theory of the East, and that his fellorr citizens, confound-
ing philosophical with political heresy, necused him of
Medicina for we find that he ended his days in a voluntary

exile at Lampsacus. Pericles was his'pupil, Thucydides
the historian received instruction from him, as well as
Democritus, Empedocles, Metrodorus of Lampsacus, AEsop
the tragedian, Socrates and Themistocles, while Euripides
lived on terma of intimacy with him.

But the element of fire was not omitted, exercising as

it does a kind of natural ascendancy over the other ele-
ments3 reducing solide to their inorganic constituents;
driving water before it as vapour into air; and assimi-
lating apparently this latter element as its own proper

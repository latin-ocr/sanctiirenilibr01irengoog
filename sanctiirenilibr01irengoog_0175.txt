was probably communicated soon after Victor's accession aurea
to the pontificale an. 188. If therefore at this date Ιῐε-’““““’“
ussus had attained his sixtietb year, about 128 an. would
be indicated for his birth. But in the body of his work
o. Hoer. he speaks of having heard Polycarp, already far
edvaneed iu γεω, ἕν τῇ πρότη ἡμῶν ἡλικίᾳ, and the term
has been identified more closely than the phrase can justify,
with that used in the Epistle to Florinus, παῖς oio ἔτι. For
the author himself explains the expression as meaning
1ειη-1η lise, extending to about the thirtieth year3 at least
it is impossible to obtain any more satisfactory meaning
than this from the translator’s words, quia autem triginta
naamam cetos prima indolis est juvenis, (ὅτι di τῶν τριᾶ·

κοντα ἑτῶν ἦ ἡλικία πρώτη τῆς· drods'csais ἔστι νέας). Itis

the 'cardinal point that separatos the youthful from the
formed character. It is not necessary indeed to suppose,
that Irenaeus spent the whole of this πρώτη vitreio at Smyrna
under its venerable Bishop. The cause of the Gospel in
sil probability drew him into Gaul, soon after the age had
been attained for ordination; and Polycarp, who was not less
than ³eighty-six years of age when he suffered martyrdom,
an. 167, may have survived the departure of Irenaeus from
Smyrna for ten or fifteen years, and yet have been more
than threescora years aad ten, when our author last heard
the sonnd of his voice. The expression therefore, ἐν τῇ
πρώτῃ ἡμῶν ἡλικίᾳ, in no way militates against the suppo·
sition now advanced, that the birth of Irenaeus may be re·
serred to an earlier period by at least ten years, than has
usually been deemed possible, and that aa. 130 is no very
unlikely date for this event.

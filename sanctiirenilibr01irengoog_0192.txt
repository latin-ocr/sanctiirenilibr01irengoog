ΜΝ book, now known under the well ventilated neme of Hip-
ἓξὲξ, polytus; and the var. tect. in question are noted in Miller’s
edition of the Philosophumeno.

Itis unnecessary to enter further into this curious his-
tory of the Frepmento Aneedota, than to stete that Maffei,
who had a subsequent opportunity of visiting and inspect-
ing the collection, ¹disagreed with Pfeff with respect to
the genuineness of these fragments, but never denied their
existence; they disappeared therefore after his second
visit. Pfaff answered this critique from Tubingen‚ and with
the exception of a second papcr of Maffei‚ 1716, for many
years he heard no more upon the subject of the Turin
MSS.. until the Benedictine edition of Irenaeus was reprint
ed at Venice in 1734. He was attached in it upon other
pointe; hut hie good faith as regards the existence of
these Amodata remained unimpeached. The fragments
therefore are offered to the reader, as possessing ²good
external authority, end far more convincing internal proof
of genuineness, thannan always be expected in such brief

extraots.
It may he added that the rceder is indebted to the

spicilegium Solesmeme of M. Pitra‚ for the Armenian
extracts, the lest thet demand our notice.

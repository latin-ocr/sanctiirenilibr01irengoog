naun Fragments, all quote the work under the same title,
Q and the author himself indicates itin several passages
as the work proceeds. The ancient MSS. of the
Latin Version designate it either as, Redoryatio et Eversio
falso cognominato spuitione, or as, Eaprotratio et Eversio
solere Agnitioais. The short title, Contra Hoereses, is that
by which it is now more usually known. Of the Latin
Version it is sufficient to say, that the Celt who made it
wesin every way inferior to the work that he undertook3
independently of the barbarismo and solecisms with which
his style abounds, he frequently ir totally unable to catch
his author's meaning. The servile fidelity that he evi·
dently aimed at, as the translator's highest perfection, is
in some degree compensative, and a literal transfusion into
Greek often proves the most satisfactory guide for the
solution of obscure passages. The translator's blunders
in the Latin, as well as his frequent misappreciation of the
Greek, induce the suspicion that neither of these classical
languages was vernacularly known to him, but that the
words of his original were truly descriptive of himself, as
both born and bred ἐν βαρβάρῳ διαλέκτῳ. Tm antiquity
0f this version makes it invaluable; internal evidence per-
suades the judgment that Tertullian wrote his Treatise
r. Valentinum, after an. 199, with this version before his
eycs; Massuet's comparison of tho two texts in his second
Dissertation is very convincing; when the translator trips,
Tertullian also stumbles3 and too many minute peculiari·

ties of nomenclatore and style are found to agree in both,

to be the result of accident. ¹Cyprian possibly, and
'Augustin certainly, copied this version.

The recovery of the Syrian fragments that are found
at the close of the work, gives colour to the supposition
advanced hythe Benedictine 'editon that a Syriae version

in the case of Sophia, and prevented her onward move·
ment. She remained in solitude therefore, without the
Pleroma, the victim of manifold distracting πάθη, fearing,
doubting, and, as having received no formation κατοὶ γνῶσιν,

peculim· to Enthymesis, that did not attach to Sophia,
namely her conversion, from which there first resulted
the prototypal soul of the world, and the Demiurge3 and
afterwards from her sorrow, seor, and various πάθη, all
other created substance. So in her toars ¹flowed forth the
clement of touton and light from her hysterical laugh3
while her grief and consternation gave birth to other
elementa. Even so, however, Valentinus may not have
intended that the ¹gross matter of the elementa now had
their origin, but only that their ideal substance received
its being in her πάθηε for it is stated in the sequel that the
Demiurge was the maker of the light and of the neaoy, of
the bnoyant and of the gravitating, ³and it was only then
that matter had its μέθεξις with ideal form. If so we have
another point of connexion between Achamoth ind the
unformed Platonic matter. ,Thus τόποι, the space that

my The ancient religion of Persis appears to have been

Fffiff'f far more closely ullied with the Pentheism of the Brahmin,

““““““ than with the Polytheism of the Greek3 and it vves from

this source possibly that Thales and his successore in the

Ionio school of physical philosophy borrovved their first

principles. They believed th‘at a Divine life existed in

the elementary forms of matter. So the Persian peid Di-

1 . vine honours to the primury στοιχεῖα, es Hnaonoros says,

θύουσι dd ἡλίῳ τε καὶ σελήνῃ rol ’γῇ rol eropi vrci nidore xci

ἀνέμοισι. The natural mention, on object of deep ond super·

stitione veneration in primitive times, may have given rise

to idolatry when Hrnouoros wrote, bnt the proof is not

made out, that the Persicus knew anything of the Zabian

practices of the ¹inlerior Shemitic tribes, before their yoke

was imposed upon those tribes. As compared with the

luter religione belief of heathenism‚ the old Persian religion

was veneroble for its greater purity, though it vves only

e comparative purity. Whutever degree of truth it retained

vvas derived traditionally from the very cradle of the humen

race3 it vves no mere product of human intellect. es Beru-

Τα δὲ τρία καὶ τέσσαρα, ἄτερ ἐστὶν ἑβδομάδος ουσία, την

the Maroosian theory may be traced back to some such
origin as this.

Proceeding from the primary to the secondary deve-
lopment of the heathen religione idea, it may be observed
that Egypt no doubt gave its lirst impulse to the idolatry
of classical Graece& Its mythology, based upon the
physical phenomena of a southern sky, and a land teeming

vith the ricbest products, received a magnificent develop-
ment, when reprodnoed in the myths of the keen·vvitted

and poetical Greek. But the very brightness of the
intellectual creations of this wonderful people, in the
infant state of their political existence, dezzled them,
and prevented them from traciug excellencies in the
deeper truths preserved, here a little and there a little,
among their barbarian prototypes. They vvere bad
observers of Egyptian antiqnities, and missed much of
the latent meaning that was veiled beneath the substance
of the Egyptian mythology, while they seized upon the
aesthetical features that presented themselves externnlly,
and aoclimated them among the hills and vales of Greece.
A fevv of the vvisest and best cf their rece, rising above
the ³mythical traditione that served to engross the religious
sense of the multitude, reverted to the sources of their
intellectual and political history, oud found in the ances-
tral sanes of Egypt some traces at least of the wisdom
that they songht.

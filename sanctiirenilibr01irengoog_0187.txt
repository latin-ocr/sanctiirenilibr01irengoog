also have recorded, that Irenaeus dedicated a treatise opuscula
to Marcianus, most probably on the principal articles of*
the Creed, it being upon the Apostolical Preachinp, a term
frequently applied to the early symbol of faith3 such a
relic would have been of rare velue if it had descended to
us. Two of the ¹fragments published by Feuardent, and
the 'second and fourth of Pfaff, may have been taken from
this work. Eusebius again speaks of certain³miscellaneous
dissertatione, in which the author makes mention of the
Epistle to the Hebrews, and of the Book of Wisdom. It
wesin all probability a collection of sermons and exposi-
tione of various texts and passages of Scripture3 anduuder

this head we may rank the various Greek fragments that
indicate a commentary upon portions of the historical
books of Scripture3 the Syriae fragment from an exposi-
tion of the Song of Songs; the Armenian homily upon the
sons of Zebedee, which may represent a genuine produc·
tion of Irenaeum also the fragments edited by Cramer and
Miinter; and the last, from the Vienna collection. It may
be added, that the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the Book
of Wisdom are mentioned, not as forming the main subject
of these διαλέξεις, but because the latter was universslly
classed with ecclesiastical, i. e. apocryphal warte, and the
⁴former was not received uniuersally as canonical. The

Menander was the disciple and immediate follower of

Simon. He was the third of a Samariten succession, reck-

pretended to be the promised Messiah3 and each of these
impostore gave out that neither ¹himself nor his followers
should be subject to death. If the PseudoOlementioe
lwritings may be trusted, these three teachers represent a
³Samaritan sect, that existed before the birth ol Christ.
In all respecta, however, the account given by Irenaeus
with respect to Menander's notions, finds a counterpart
in what Hippolytus has said concerniug Simon. The pupil
added nothing original, so far as we have the meana oi

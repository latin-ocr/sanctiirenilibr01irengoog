millionwmod, for moulded (τρεπομένη f. l. τυπουμένη) by
reason she embraces all forms and ideas. And con-
genital with her is Love of the first and mightiest of all,
which is one and the same with the Good; this she desires
and follows after, but she avoids and repels all participation
with Evil, being to both indeed aa space and matter, but
inclining always of her own accord to the better prin-
ciple, occasioning in it the procreative impulse of insemi-
nating her with emanatione and types in which she rejoioes

Further, the Egyptian mythology indicates the remote
origin of the Valentinian classification ol the Pleroma into
three groupes. For Herodotus speaks of a similar distribu-
tion of Egyptian deities²3 ἘυἜλλησι μέν νυν νεώτατοι τῶν

possibly the ³five born of Rhea, marking the addition of
five days to the year of 360. The dodeoad emanated
froin the ogdoad, *ἐκ τῶν ὁκτώ θεῶν οἱ δυώδεκα θεοὶ
ἐγένοντο, τῶν Ἠρακλέα ἕνα νομίζουσι. But the ogdoad was
the primary groupe, ‘rods di derel θοοῦς τούτους προτέρους

ll Pnumssonsu THEOLOGY.

Early contributiou; they were amalgamated successively by the
Fffigff's Gnostic schools‚ and eventually all met in the Valentinian

A brief review of the earlier forms of religione belief
so far as History‚ whether Sacred or Profaue, has revealed
them to us, will enable the reader to jndge 'of the cor-
rectness of this view. ’ ’

Before Abraham was chosen to be the especinl guardian
of the truth‚ we may trace the existence ofin primitive
theology upon earth. Melchizedek‚ most probably of the
racc of Shem‚ whose genealogy coincided with that of
Abraham in some ancestral link, was a Preache'rof Righte-
ousners and Priest of the Most High God sud he ex-
pressed doctrines that, without doubt, were honded down
from a more ancient source. Are we to imagine that the
same truths were altogether hidden from other collateral
brauches of the same widely sprendiug stock3 such ns the
children of Elam, end Aram, aud Asshur, the Joktanidae of
the Arab coasts, or the Shemitic dispersion of the days
of Pelsg? .

If we follow the patriarch Abraham in his descent to
Egypt, we observe clearly that the primitive traditione of
the Asiatic hed not yet wholly evaporated. They still
possessed in direct desecat, a fragmeutnry rsy of the re-
ligious light inherited by the sons oi Nonh3 for we cannot
fail to bc struck with the similarity of saith in funda-
mental veritieS, that brought Abraham aud the Egyptian
king into closer relations than could have subsisted without
it. Their intercourse was established upon tbe immutable

marn basis of justice sud truth; whilst Hagar, the Egyptian
handmaid of Sarah, confessed saith iu an All-wisc Deity‚

onusto· aad was favoured with an angelic vision aad message.

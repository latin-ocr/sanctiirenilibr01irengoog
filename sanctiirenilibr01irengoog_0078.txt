effi* at the time ol the Babylonian Captivity, when the first
-—— deportation of the ten tribes took place, bordes of immi-
grants from ¹Bebylon replaced them, aud took possession
of the most desirable portione of Samaria The intro-
duction of their religion, aud their intermarriages with
tbe remnant of Israel, caused tbe deadly feud that ever
since existed between tbe Jew of pure blood and tbe
hybrid Samariten. Simon Magus, a Samariten, taught a
completely Zoroastrian doctrine. But in all probability it
was a doctrine that bad subsisted in certain families of
Samaria almost from tbe days os Shalmaneser. So also the
earlier Gnostic heresiarche settled at Alexandria as immi·
grants from Syria and the East; aud tbe mixture of Ori-
ental notions to be detected iu the systcms of Basileides,
Valentinus, Carpocrates, and others, was the effect of
early association; scarcely of coutact with the pbiloso-
phising and synoretic Jew of Alexandria

One consideration must bare greatly commended the
Oriental and other systema of theosophy to thinking
minds, as compared with the religious belief of tbe more
civilised nations of the world3 which was, that whereas in
Greece and Rome polytheism was upbeld as the religion
of the body politic, a bigber saith possessed the Eastern
mind, which recoiled witb bearty abhorrence from the
gross debasement of every Western form of religion.
Philosophy, in fact, gained a religious element in its union
with Theosopby; and prejudicial as a resulting Gnosticism
was to the peace of the Chureb during the first two cen·
turies, it is impossible not to see that the evil was not
unmixed with good3 aud this concretion of ideas possibly
ufforded a temporary place of rest to the weary spirit of
humanity‚ in its transition from tbe abominatione of pa-
genism to the pure saith of tbe Churcb of Christ. Giveu

on the one side the gross darkness oi beatben idolatry‚

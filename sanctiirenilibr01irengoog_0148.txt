perfected so completely the hermony of the Pleroma, that
each AEon became one with the others, end the style and
title of each individnnl became the designation cf the
reet3 then the entire body, like the Siren, eo poetically ima-
gined by Plato aethe harmony of each mundane orbit‚ or
like the rolling epheree of Pythagorae, or, if it may be
added without irreverenee, like the Sone of God of the
patriarch Job, peeled forth the ⁴prnieee of Bytbne, who
reciproceted their joy.

the formation of J eeue or Soter, τελειότατον κάλλος τεκαὶ
ἄστρον πληρώματος. Miseppreeiated Scripture once more

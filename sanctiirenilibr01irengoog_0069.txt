reech, may be inserted. Ohoiee indeed must be made
of one from three altematives. Either Plato borrowed
the groundwork of some of his most striking develop-
ments of thought from his Egyptian instructore, which
still held their ground ia the Egypt of Plutarch's day ; or
the system that Plutarch describes was adopted from the
writings of Plat03 or, which was more probably the case,
the Egyptian notione that received a certain determinate
colouring from Plato, were subsequently interpretcd to the
initiated by the Egyptian priests, consistently with that
Platonic colouring: so that if the philosopher received the
rude forms of his ideas from Egypt, and shaped them
variously into one harmonicus theory, Egypt received
her own back again in a higher state of elaboration.

to our shores, and are sent back again to their native
habitatin their highest form of development, more beauti-

But there is a marked distinction to be observed
between the language of the master in speaking of his
system of eternal Ideas‚ and that of Philo, Plutarch, and
lamblichus. With later writers these ideas were little
else than a divine model or coemptor of things create,
having a necessary subsistence in the mind of the Deityt
they were the engraved type of the impressed scal. They
had no other true existence3 end this simple notion
may well have existed in Egypt before the day of Plato.
But the Platonis ideas, ¹or παραδεῖγμα, had a true subjec-
tive existence, aad formed an intermediate world of real
intelligible being, lower than the Supreme Good, but
higher than this created world; eternal laws, having a
necessary existence independently of, though incidentally

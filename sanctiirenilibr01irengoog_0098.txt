Q he has engrafted a strangely unsatisfactory account If it
be considered improbable that so considerable a develop-
ment of Gnosticism as the Monadic theory, owed its origin
to a youth who died at the early age of ¹serenteen‚ the
probability will also follow, that Carpocrates was not the
first to style himself Gnostic, but that the Ophites, as
Hippolytus states, first assumed the name. And this is
the next system that presente itself for consideration.

The assertion of Philastrius that the Ophites formed a
sect before the time of Christ, an idea adopted by ²Mos
heim, cannot for a moment hold its ground, in presence of
the additional light that we now derire from the φιλοσο-
φούμενα of Hippolytus, ³who says that they made frequent
reference to the words of Christ3 in fact their quotatious
⁴from scripture, aud especially from S. John, must refer
them to the close of the first century, or the beginning of
the secoad; in the early part of which they certainly
existed as a distinct sect. The name Oplite is the equiva-

lent of ὅΝαασσηνοί, derived from the word vij), ὄφις.
But that root, as a lietb, is the vor adcanto whereby
the exercise of magical impostore is designated3 and it
occurs iu this sense in describing the addiction of Ma-
prinam nasses to forbidden aris, in apposition with ultimi,
yraiarcr, wizorda It is not improbable therefore, that the
adherente of this sect were originally called Naassenes

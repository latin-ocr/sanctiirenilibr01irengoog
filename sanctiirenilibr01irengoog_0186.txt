““““ from it by Eusebius. An extract from an Epistle from
Irenaeus to Victor, upon the lapse of Florinus, who was
one of the presbytery of the Roman Church, is found
among the Syriae fragments.

The Pascha] controversy caused the production of the
treatise π. τοῦ σχὶσματος, addressed to Blestus, ¹an Alex-
andrian apparently, who was a friend end copresbyter
with Florinus, but sided with the Asiatica as regards the
Paschal controversy; as the Libellus addedto the Proscrip
tio of Tertullian asserta: Blostas lounter ludaismum cult
introduceres Pascha enim dicebat non aliter nutodiendum

that he lapsed into Valentinianism with Florinus, but he
misunderstood the words of Eusebius, who simply says
'that they fell simultaneously, each subsiding into his own
peculiar form of error. The third of Pfaff's fragments
seems to have been taken from this ³treatise.

Another treatise, π. τῆς ἐπιστήμης, is also mentioned by
⁴Eusebius‚ and named in one of the Syriae fragments,
which speoifies also that it was directed against the

Valentinian heresy. This indicates plainly the omission of

dation; for the Syriae gives some uotion of the nature of
the trectise π. ἐπιστήμης, and shows that it was no refuta-
tion of pagan, but of Gnostio, and more especially of
Valentinian, error. θΤῑιθ first of the Pfaffian fragments

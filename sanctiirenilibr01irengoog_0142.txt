Ratio mue series of live and oi six συζυγίαι evolved from the first

Dm Ogdoad. Here again there ses considerable discrepancy

min the several sections of the Valentinian school. Irenrens

says throughout, that Λόγος end Ze», evolved the Decad,

while the Dodeesd proceeded forth from Ἄνθρωπος aud

Ἐκκλησία, whereas Hippolytus says that Νοῦς and Ἀλήθεια

sent forth the Desect, the ¹Dodeead being the offset of

Λόγος and Ζωὴ. Ressons are assigned by him that give

rather an air of probability to this statement: the names

also of the AEons are in harmony with it. He says, that

Νοῦς and Ἀλήθεια perceiving that Λόγος aad Ζοοὶ possessed

the generative faculty, when‘Avdpmror and Ἐκκλησία were

evolved, evineed their gratitude to the Supreme by put·

. ο. ting forth a Decad, the most 'perfect number of AEons3

because Bythus was the most perfect, ss having evolved

by his own individusl energy, the source and germ of the

entire Pleroma. Similsrly Νοῦς and Ἀλήθεια being imper-

fect, as not possessing that power of independent produc-

tion, Λόγος and Ζωό honoured them with a series, butes

an ³imperfect number, and put forth the Dodecad. Thus

the Decod describes attributes and qualities that agree

closely nith the hypothesis that they emansted from Nus3

and the mele terms were Bythias, Aper-atos, Autophyes,

Akinetos, sud Monogenes· while the feminine σόζυγοι ere

with the Infinite, with su anticipated solution of the result-

⁴Hedoac, Syncrosis, end Macaria.

The Dodecad exhibits names that are no less appli-

Paeona ol the Deity revesled itself at length in active energy,

ἓξὲξ ιιι all ol them points to be traoed in the following

“““““ story ι-Φησῖ περὶ τοῦ Διθι ὁ Εὔδοξοι μυθολογεῖν eti-yml-
ους, uls τῶν σκελῶν συμπεφυκότων αὐτῷ pri δυνάμενοι βαδί-

ζειν, ἐπ’ αἰσχύνης ι’ρημίᾳ διέτριβεν· ἦ δι’ 'loss διατεμοῦσα καὶ
διαστήσασα τὰ με’ρη ταῦτα τοῦ adiperos, ἀρτίποδα τήν
πορείαν παρέσχεν· αἰνίττεται ‹ls' sol lad τούτων o' μῦθος, ὅτι

ἀφανεῖ βεβηκώς, sis ιγιὶνισιν lat ιινῆσιιυι προῆλθεν. The
terme vois καὶ λόγος, as applied to the Divino Being‚ may
be neo-Platonic, but the general teaehing ol this myth
is, if I mistalse not, ¹proe·Platonic; it is lar more likely
that the doctrine that it veile, was in substance handed to
the father ol Greek philosophy by his priestly instructore,
than that the fable should have been framed in Egypt at

’ ι later date, when the tidal wave of Greek civilisation
spreading southwards, made it so much themora difficult
for such stories ιο be palmed upon the people with any
hope ol their acceptation.

Τλι same observatione apply ιο the Platonic theory of
the mundane soul. The universe, in this theory, was ani-
mated by a soul of Divine harmony3 and without offering

which Plato makes the mundane soul ιο be evolved, a
mue that Cicero, in speaking of an intellectual eruo ss
ιιιιυιινο Platonis obscurius, takes ιο λι ιλι abstract type of
all thetis obscure, it may be sufficient ιο observe, first„
that ο community of origin is clearly indicated between

this portion ol the Platonie theory and the Pythagor-ean
derivatico of all things from the mystieel powers of 'num-

therefore is remarkable sor the light tica, with loss also oi the aspirato, ἀριθ-
that it throws upon the ancient Egyp μόι. But dpudptr may have been the

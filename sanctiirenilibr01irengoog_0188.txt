opuscula. main work of Irenaeus contains no clear quotation from
*- this epistle, that may certainly be referred to it; and for,
this reason perhaps, Eusebius, as fully believing its canoni-
cal authority, adduces Irenaeus, an unexceptionable witness

upon a subject that had not passed unquestioned in Western

Christendom. Eusebius mentions no other works of Ire·
naeus, but ¹his words seem intended to eonvey the notion,
that other writings may have been extant in the West,
that had not yet become known te him in Palestine;
accordingly his expression cannot justify the exclusiou
from our list, of works represented by fragments that
have come down to us. Such for example is the quota-
tien from a treatise de Resurraettene Dominico, found in a
ssew-m. Syriae, and, in an interpolated form, in 'an Armenian ver·
sion; the high antiquity of the Syriae MS. in which this
passage is found, and it was written an. 562, is to a cer·
tuin extent a voucher for the genuineness of its originnl;
infernal evidence shews that the longer extract in the
Armenian contains a considerable interpolation, and that
the Syriae is the most faithful to the lest Greek text.
Maximus quotes two detached sentences from a work to
'Demetrius de Fida, which ispassed over in silence both by
Eusebius and Jerome3 the Latin translation also of the
fragment received by Feuardent from Faber, who obtained
it from some collection now unknown,is from a Sermon
cd Demetrium. It is by no means unlikely that the
treatise inscribed to Demetrius should both have been
unknown te Eusebius when he wrote his history, and have
become so rare in the time of S. J creme as to have escaped
his notice: its inscription to a deaeon of Vienne, marks
that it was of a purely elementary character, it was a

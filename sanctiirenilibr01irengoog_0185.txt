may formerly hare been in existence. The general simi· Syrias
larity of extracta occurring in duplicate and triplicate iffi,
copisa, points to one single original; and the high antiquity ’'—
of many of the codices in which they occur, is not con·
sistent with the suspicion that they· may have been copied
and reeopied from isolated quotations. The extracts how·
ever are before the public, and we may be content to v
leave the question to be settled by the discoveries of a
future generation. These Syriae fragments also indicate
a subdivision of the Books, that gives a general confirma-
tion to the Latin headings of the Arundel Ms„ as shcwn
in the present edition. The ¹Syriac subdivision very pro·
bably agreed with that indicated by Procopius, who quotes
the passage that refers to Adam's tonica pelliceo, III. xxxv.
(Tom. u. p. 128), as being found in the 59th section of the
third Book.

The names of a few other treatises by IrenaeuS, and
some scattered fragments, have come down to us, His
Epistle to Florinus‚ also known by the title π. τῆς μανψ
χίας, ἦ π. τοῦ μὴ εἶναι τόν Oscis ποιητήν κακῶν, has perished,
with the exception of thc small portion preserved by
Eusebius, and found among the fragments in the second
volume. Florinus appears to have so insisted upon the
unity of the Deity, as to have made him the author of evil,
a position never yet assumed by any heresy. The treatisc
caused Florinus to change his ground, and he took refuge
in the Valentinian hypothesis3 upon this, IrenaeuS, who
appears to have had a degree of regard for the offender
from ancient recollectiou, wrote the 2work π. τῆς ὀγδοάδος,
against the Valentiniau Ogdoad. The solemn adjuration

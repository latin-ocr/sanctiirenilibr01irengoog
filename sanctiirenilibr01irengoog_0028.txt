early eonciseness of the sacred history, and of the inspired rc-
Ffflpt eorde, enable us to place under investigation. Thus J ethro,
M the father-in-law of Moses, was priest of Midian, but the
lilii wisdom and godliness of his counsel to the elect deliverer
of God’s people‚ and his faultless confession, mark that he

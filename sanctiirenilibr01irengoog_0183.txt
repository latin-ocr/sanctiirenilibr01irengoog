mentioned, and the author of the Qu. et Καρ. nd Orthe 'applied
docos, as also the later statement of Gregory of Tours, and Q
certain Martyrologies. The fact that Tertullum, Eusebius,
Epiphanius, Ephrem Syrus, Augustin, Theodora, Cyril of
Alexandria, as well as these early Syriae fragments, and
the existing Latin MSS, exeepting the coc. Voss, all
withhold from Ireuaeus the title of Martyr, will be eon-
sidered by many to be a convincing proof that it does not
eorreotly belong to him; a conclusion in which they cer·
tainly will not be shakeu by the reasoning of the Benedic-
tine editor. The active part that Irenaeus took in the
Paschal question in the elosing years of the second een·
tury, justifies the supposition that he may have lived
through the first five or six years of the third; when he
would have attained‚ according to the supposition above,
to an age of between seventy and eighty years.

It has already been shewn that the work of Irenaeus,
c. Haereses, must have been written between an. 182 and
188 ; i.e. between the fifty-fourth aud sixtieth years of
life; and the vigour, judgmeut, and experienee that it
displays, well agrees with this supposition. It was written
in Greek; the Latin version, and the Syriae fragments, oon·
tain abundant internal evidence of a Greek origin. This
language was adopted possibly, as Massuet says, because
the friend at whose request it was undertaken was a
Greek, but more probably because the Greek language
was at that time more ¹oeeumem'e than the Latin; also, the
Valentinian and Marcionita heresies that it meets, were
far more destructively spread in the East and at Alexandria
than in the West. There ean be little doubt but that its ,
title was that assigned to it by Eusebius, π. 'chappele καὶ

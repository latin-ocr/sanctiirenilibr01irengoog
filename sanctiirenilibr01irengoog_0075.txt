tinctured with the cosmopolitan character of the place. Q
It no longer represented the echools oi Hellas; and even-

tually a system grew up, formed upon the eclectio prin-

ciple of sharing the distinctive peculiaritiee of all. This
fusion, so lar as the Greek modes of philosophy arc con·

by ¹D10oarrs marowa although he reduced into order
rather, and systematised the eclectio principle, whereby
already ’Auaroowus had united the Academic and Stoic
teachiug; Sraaao, the geographer, had harmoniaed the
latter with the Peripatetic method; Sorrow, the younger,
had combined Stoicism with the ancient theory of Pr·

The Platonic theory of matter, also, harmonises with so Phanio
much as we know of Egyptian speculatione with respect ιο ἓξὲξ
that subject, so full of mystery to the heathen mind, and ““““”““
the cause of so much inconsistent and inconclusive reason-
inginthe wisest teachers. of course we must not expect to
find anything like the Platonis retinements in these specu-
latione. For this reason we might pass over the abstruse
theory of Plato, if it were not very evident that it forms
the groundwork of the Valentinian notion of the Demi-
urge and of the material creation. Matter, then, in the
system of Plato is considered in a threefold point of view;
oceupying space, it had an eternal subsistence as χώρα or
τόπος, the formal vehiculum of matter devoid of organisa-
tion or order. But unorganised matter, thus eomprehended
within determinate limite, had eternally a bodily nature;
andthat which is corporeal is subject to change3 therefore,
antecedently ιο its organisation hy the Creator, matter
vas for ever in a transitional state, and passing from one
ehaotic condition, void of order, to another. To these
tvo pheses succeeded now a third, in which matter was
organised, and its erratic tendencies brought under the
Divine rule of form and order hy a μέθεξις, or adunation
with the ideal types, that had subsisted eternally in the
Divinc mind; but in this again we trace Pythagorean and
Platonis theories back to one common source; Aristotle
evidently identifies the two systems with each other, as

virtually one, in saylng‚ οἱ Πυθαγόρειοι μιμήσει rei ὄντα

Novis Plato horrowed anything from Egypt, the more
ancient portions of Egyptian teaching, without doubt, are
to be sought in the myths that have been preserved to us;
and the main features of the Platonis theory of matter are
discernible in an Egyptian fable recorded by Plutarch.
The substantial etemity of matter, its acosmic corporeity,
and its subsequent organisation, when the passive power

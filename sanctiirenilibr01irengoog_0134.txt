copim Valentinian Christ to the Pleroma after a transient efful-
Q gence upon Achamoth3 while the essential aroma as it

were of Sonhood, that, as Basilides said, still attached to
the Spirit, was no less evidently represented in the llil
ἀφθαρσίας that adhered to Achamoth as the gift of Christ
and of the Holy Spirit. It may be observed in passing,
that the asceticam of Christian instruction that Valentinus
had received is manifested in his doctrine of the Spirit.
In the Basilidian scheme the Spirit was said clearly not to
trix- be consubstantial with the Sonhood; though the odonr of
Sonhood passed not wholly over from it; but Valentinus
in correction oi this gross misappreciation of Christian doc·
trine, declared that Christ and the Holy Spirit are consub
stantial with each other3 while the relation in which they
stood to the AEous of the Pleroma, the various modes of
the Divine subsistente, was to reduce all to one principle
of unity, so that under the intluence of one heaveuly
. hond, all were equally Divine Mind‚ all were Logos, and
Truth, and Life, dcc, &c.; in other words, Christ aud
the Holy spirit, ns existing in tbe perfect consubstantiva
tion of the ¹Pleroma, were themselves consubstantial with
the Divine Entities of which it consisted. Further, in the
Basilidian scheme, the unformed mass of 'mattea called
there, ἀμορφία aud πανσπερμία, was first evolved, and from
this unformed mass the psychic ogdoad, or μέγας ἅρχων,
had his being. ln a similar manner the Passion of Ache·
moth gave rise in the first instance to priorory matter, τοῦ

principle, from whence Demiurge emanated, the Ruler 0f

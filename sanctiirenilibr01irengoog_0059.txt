PHILOSOPHY. xxxvii

Thus Anaxagoras, retaining the term ἄπειρος, as one snm
now well established in philosophical language, applied it ff..
to νοῦς, ns wellas to the physical world. He spohe indeed mm
of the sky and air as α’μφότερα ἄπειρα ἐόντα, but there are
also expressions of his, in speaking of the infinity of N οὖν,
that strongly remind us of the α’πιιρία of the Supreme
Principle iu the Gnostic theorias, aud of the impossibility
that it should come into content with matter. 1Νοῦν ds'
ἐστιν ἄπειρον καὶ αὐτοκρατὲς, καὶ μέμικται οὐδενὶ χρήματι,
ἀλλά μόνας αὐτόν ἐφ’ ἑωυτοῦ ἐστίν. The Gnostic axiom
also, that things visible are the retlex of things unseen,
agrees remarkably with his notion, ‘vir τῶν diriter κατα·
λήψεως τό φαινόμενα εἶναι κριτήριον. PLA'ro only illus·
trated this dictum of his predecessor, when he said with
greater olearum& 8νκεῐσα ἀνάγκη τόνδε τόν κόσμον εἰκόνα
τινός εἶναι, and more enigmatically‚ ὅ τί περ πρὸς γένεσιν
⁴orhrio, τοῦτο πρός πίστιν ἀλήθεια. Like Thales and
Pythagoras, Anaxagoras also journeyed into Egypt iu
⁵quest of knowledge, though nothing peculiarly Egyptian
is to be detected in his system of physics; but in all
probability he derived from this source a higher notiou of
Divine causation; so Aarsrornn describes his principle, ⁶‹ip-

upon this point cannot be superseded by the negative tes
timony of Hippolytus, who advsnces nothing with respect
to the Basilidian origination ol evil, he merely states that
the heresiarch ³ccrefully avoided all expressions that could

the eternal antagonism of a good and s bod principle,
there would have been no such necessity for asserting
pointedly, that which must have stood forth as a funda-
mental principle in his Greed Still no inconsistency is
involved, and modern writers, without doubt, have rightly
classed him among those vho adopted the Persian theory
of two aboriginal principles, Good and Evil. Thus ‘Matter
and Beausobre have identified thet which Basilides said

of the diarchia principle, with the heretic‘s own views

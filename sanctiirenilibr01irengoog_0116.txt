m· ιιιορη In another point oi view the definition that the world
‘'imm'' aas ἐξ οὐκ ὄντων, was iu direct antagonism with the Pla·
tonic theory oi eternally pre-existent ideas, aad chaotic
matter: but it harmonised with the Aristotelian reasoning‚
whereby all substance having been divided into ¹penas,
speeies, aud the individuol, the ἄτομος or indiuidual had
precedence, and was termed ἡ τρῶτη οὐσία, aud ἡ iscoram*
aiolo, because neither genus nor species ²could subsist
independently ot the individual3 these therefore were
secondom substantes 01¹ 3θοθτυροι ariolos. Thus primary
substance indicated some actual subsisting thing; ιοοονιιέοτη
substance a mere quality, which cannot exist spart from
that which it qualifies. Hence before the creation of in·
dividual substance, so far as the world of matter was eon-
cerned, *ἦν ὅλωι οὐδέν. But the Deity is not to bc defined,
and is incomprehensible, and it was in this negative point
of view, and not at all in the language oi atheim, that
Basilides set forth his idea of creation3 οὑκ ὢν Oscis
tiberinos, ἀναισθήτως, ἀβούλως, ἀπροαιρέτως, ἀπαθῶς, ἀνεπι-
θυμὴτως, κόσμον ἠθέλησε ποιῆσαι. But he instantiy cheeks
this positive assertion, and gives it a symbolical meaning,
T ri le* ἠθέλησε λέγω aquariae χάριν, ἀθολνὶτωι, sai ἀνοήτων
roi ἀναισθήτων, that is, as compared with human will, and

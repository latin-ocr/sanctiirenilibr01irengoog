Of the time and circumstances of the death of S. lte-
naeus nothing is known. And it is doubtful whether the
title of ¹Martyr properly belongs to him. S. Jerome terma
him Martyr3 but tha word was ’added possibly by some later
hand. The account of Gregory of Toms, as quoted by
Massuet, may be taken for what it is worth; and it is per·
haps as trustworthy as Feuardeut's account of the recovery
of the relies of the Saint‚ from the collection of Chirurgus
quidam Catholicae, who having saved them from the fury
of the Huguenots (Hanosticorum sarcre), restored them
to the municipality and Church of Lyons. Upon this
point it is certainly remarkable, that although citatione are
not unfrequently made by Syrian divinos from Irenaeus,
which speak of him as a disciple of Polycarp tha Martyr,
this title of honour is in only one „doubtful instance ap-
plied to Irenaeus; and iu a Syriacas-ion, which mentions
other names as belonging to the noble army of Martyrs,
that of Irenaeus follows J ustin Martyr, but simply as ³Ire·
naeus Bishop of Lyons. These extracta are found in MSS.
that are considerably older than any patristical codices of
the Western Church, having been transcribed principally
in the cinth, serenan, and eighth centurias.

the arguments of Dodwell‚ to which Massuet has nothing
better to oppose than the testimony of S. J erome, already

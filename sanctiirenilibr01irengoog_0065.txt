by him to the universe, betrays its inductiwe origin. The Pyuaga
harmony of the spheres also, for ever, as he affirmed„ w
ringing in mortal ears, but unperceired‚ because never ““““““
absent, indicated the deeper meaning of his theory of the

powers of numbers, whose continual presence in eras, bore

the stamp of the Eternal; though as regards man, they

had existed hitherto only as a latent and unsuspected

energy.

This harmony, symmetry, proportior, or whatever else
Pythagoras may have termed the ultimate principle of
his system, was as the ¹Divinc Soul oi the whole; it was
the Unit out of which the entire progression of numbers lepram·
emanated3 and so represented multiplicity in unity. The
lionad in itself could not constitute number3 but ’by
reection upon its own nature it evolved the Dyad, the
symbol of matter, the fruitlul mother of an infinite erolu-
tional series of products; obiectamenta, sole origin of
a world of harmonies, and wholly abstracted from matter,
was as the divine principle in this theory.

Parthen these numerical laws and properties were
considered, not only to have adefinite relation to the
particular combinatione or powers in which they were
obserwed, but to have an universal subsistence, au casem
rial *being So the progression 3, 4, and ὃ had its parallel
in the right-angled triangle‚ the equares of the first two
numbers representing the squares of base and perpen-
dicular, and equalling that of the third quantity, or
hypothenuse. And if this relation subsiste in two such
different clemente as numbers and a plane geometrical
figure, its character, as it seems to have been reasoncd, may
be presumed to be universal; and if universality attaches
to this, so also may it attach to every other numerical

property or power whose more extended relations it is
